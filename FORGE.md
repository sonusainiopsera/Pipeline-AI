## WO-001: User Story: WO-001 - Configure Maven Test Dependencies and JaCoCo Plugin
- **Status:** completed
- **Commit:** `3df02ec`
- **Files:** 21 (+873/-1)
- **Duration:** 440ss
- **Approach:** Scaffolded the full Spring Boot 3.3.5 / Java 17 project under pipeline-troubleshooting-assistant/backend/ since the repository was empty. Then implemented WO-001: added H2 (test-scoped) dependency, maven-surefire-plugin 3.2.5, and jacoco-maven-plugin 0.8.12 to pom.xml, created SmokeTest.java with @SpringBootTest/@ActiveProfiles("test"), and created application-test.yml with H2 in-memory datasource + ddl-auto:create so the Spring context loads without a PostgreSQL instance during tests.
